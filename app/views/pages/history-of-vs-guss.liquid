  main/content: VS Guss AG produces the highest quality of small malleable and gray
    iron castings. This, according to many of our customers (including some that produce
    malleable iron themselves), is the reason why VS has such a significant market
    share in North America and Europe.<br><br>VS Guss AG was formerly known as "Vereinigte
    Schlusselfabriken GmbH", which translates as "United Key Factories". This name
    was established from a merger of two independent, privately held malleable iron
    foundries around the turn of the twentieth century. VS was originally the market
    leader for skeleton keys and fine lock components for door hardware and fine furniture.
    "VS" was an industry standard from the late eighteen hundreds throughout much
    of the last century.<br><br>The key ingredient in VS' recipe is the use of the
    finest natural bonded sand, harvested at VS-owned dried up river bed sections
    of the Rhine river. This sand allows VS to produce castings with exceptional detail
    and a smooth surface, for which we are universally known.<br><br>The introduction
    of vertical molding equipment leads to the capacity to produce several million
    keys daily, allowing "VS" to virtually cover the entire world market for its complete
    demand of skeleton keys.<br><br>With the introduction and popularization of zinc
    die castings, VS had to establish additional industrial sectors and found its
    market in the hardware and machine industries. This includes a significant percentage
    of the commercially available malleable iron demand in North America. By continuing
    its determination for the highest in quality standards, service, and productivity
    at fair pricing, VS is now one of the three largest independent suppliers of malleable
    iron castings in North America.
