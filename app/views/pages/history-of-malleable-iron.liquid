  main/content: Malleable iron is the “original” cast iron providing significant ductility.<br><br>Due
    to its annealing operation, even the thinnest wall sections below ⅛" exhibit ductility,
    as shown in the snap hook application shown above - note the substantial deformation
    possible at room temperature.<br><br>Malleable iron is particularly competitive
    with ductile iron for small castings that require secondary operations.  If a
    ductile iron part requires a heat treating operation, malleable is likely a better
    material choice!<br><br>Consider malleable iron for your choice of material that
    requires ductility and exceptional machinability.
