  main/content: 'Consider the following material options:<br><br>Malleable Iron:  Small
    castings with thin wall sections (less than 3mm).  Preferably high volume applications
    with good surface quality.  Alloys for welding available.  Dynamic loading at
    all temperatures possible.  Best iron grade for machining.  Magnetic.  Conductive.  Ideal
    steel substitute for welding applications or jobs requiring high ductility.<br><br>Gray
    Iron:  Any casting size.  Static applications with most economical solutions utilize
    this material.  Machinable material for static cases.<br><br>Ductile Iron:  Any
    casting size with wall thicknesses greater than 6mm or Â¼ inch.  Castings are machinable
    and useful for dynamically loaded applications.<br><br>Aluminum:  Light weight
    castings with good surface quality.  Can be cast in dies and permanent molds.  Application
    limited by temperature<br><br>Copper:   Brass, bronze and high conductivity copper
    parts with smooth surfaces for smaller production runs.  Permanent mold castings
    provide dimensional precision.  In-house plating, machining and assembly allows
    the supply of finished products.<br><br>Zinc:   High volume applications with
    exceptional surface quality due to die casting process.  Small to medium size
    castings.'
