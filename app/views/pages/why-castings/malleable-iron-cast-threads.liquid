    Our unique sand mixture provides for exceptional surface finish.<br><br>We use
    similarly fine sand for our shell core production. This allows us to produce internal
    threads, as shown in this picture. Currently we produce internal threads for general
    hardware and construction equipment.<br><br>Do you want to save the machining
    operation for some internal cores? Ask your VS Engineering experts!
