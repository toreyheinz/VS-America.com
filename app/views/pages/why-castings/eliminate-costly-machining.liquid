    to a unique micro-fine molding sand and the exactness of our fully-automated Disamatic
    metalcasting process, VS Precision Castings are made to very tight tolerances.

    or eliminate costly secondary machining operations by consistently producing dimensions
    up to Â± 0.010". Our accurate core boxes and powder-like core sand enable the manufacture
    of cast-in threads and other extremely fine details.<br></div>
