  main/content: Thanks to a unique micro-fine molding sand and the exactness of our
    fully-automated Disamatic metalcasting process, VS Precision Castings are made
    to very tight tolerances. Our castings afford you the opportunity in many cases
    to significantly reduce or eliminate costly secondary machining operations by
    consistently producing dimensions up to Â± 0.010". Our accurate core boxes and
    powder-like core sand enable the manufacture of cast-in threads and other extremely
    fine details.
